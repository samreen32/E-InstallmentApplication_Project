# E-Installment Application

E-Installment Application is a web-based application developed in core PHP, utilizing MySQL as the database management system, and incorporating various frontend 
technologies such as Bootstrap, Ajax, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, as well as the FPDF library for generating PDFs. It also integrates Material Icons and FontAwesome Icons for 
enhanced user interface design.


## Project Description

I have designed this application to provide installment plans for customers on different products. Shopkeepers act as administrators within the application, 
allowing them to manage products, customers, and installment plans on a yearly basis. Key features of the project include:

- **Product Management:** Shopkeepers can add, update, and delete products, specifying details such as name, price, and description.
- **Customer Management:** The application provides functionality to manage customer information, including name, contact details, installment plans, and more.
- **Installment Plans:** Shopkeepers can create yearly installment plans for customers, specifying the product, installment amounts, and due dates.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication, hashing, and sessions are implemented to ensure data privacy and security.
- **CRUD Operations:** Core PHP is used to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on products, customers, and installment plans.
- **Dynamic User Interface:** Bootstrap and Ajax are used to create a responsive and dynamic user interface, enhancing the user experience.
- **PDF Generation:** The FPDF library is utilized to generate PDF documents for invoices or installments for products to the customer.
